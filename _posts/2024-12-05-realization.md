I turned twenty one last July. It was memorable.

One thing that hits me the most is that I am aging. Like every other single human on earth.  
Confronting death doesn't scare me a bit. It is the undigestable fact that I am going to run out of time to do/try whatever I want, which makes me feel uncomfortable. It feels simple yet astounding.
Contrarily, I also do not wish to live forever, and if given an option I wouldn't choose to be an eternal. I believe being a mortal is one of the things that makes our lives to be valued and cherished.


The rational part of me knows that it is what it is and it is what it has been. But I still find it hard for me to accept.


>"You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today  
>And then one day you find, ten years have got behind you  
>No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun"


These above lines are from a song called Time by Pink Floyd.  
Probably my biggest fear is being able to relate to those in a decade or two.

I am twenty one. I have never left my country. In Fact I barely have left my own state. I feel there is so much to learn and explore.
While writing this, I listed down some of the things that I wanted to do in my life. You know, "bucket list"? Yes that thing.
I hope in a couple of years some of the stuff in that are struck out and eventually everything.

This little post is a mere attempt for me to process my thoughts so that I can look back. And I am sure I will cringe when I do.
