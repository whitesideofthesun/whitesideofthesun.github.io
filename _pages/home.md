## Hello,

I am Ananthu. I like a bunch of things and I got a chance to pursue career in one of those - writing code. Currently, I am on a break after working as a software developer for the past 3 years.

This little space here is where I express some of my thoughts in form of writings. Scrolling twitter, reviewing my FPL team for the nth time, reading about obscure things are few of the activities I find myself doing in my leisure time nowadays.



You can reach me out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/whitesideofdsun) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ananthuv/)
