I grew up in the beautiful town of Pollachi till I was 10 before moving to Coimbatore. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science back in 2021. I was not sure of my decision at that time when I opted in for Computer Science after I was denied my first choice, Physics. However, thanks to my professors, their way of teaching programming languages (C, C++) hooked me on it. Fast forward to 2024, I have now 3 years of experience working as a software developer. I have a fair bit of experience working in Python, JavaScript, and Java professionally. I enjoyed working with Python and JavaScript and not with Java. I think I won't be going back to Java anytime soon. As of now, I am on a break. Apart from my career, these are some of the topics I am interested in, with no specific order: test cricket, astronomy, football, history, and economics.


I am an optimist, and I believe we are living in one of the greatest times of humanity. We should/can use technology more in favor of the greater good of our species and our planet as a whole. I also believe in social equality. Of course, yes, in the vastness of the Universe and its existence, you, me, and our planet as a whole, nothing matters. But that does not mean that we should just let Bob kill Alice and walk away without any consequences.
